Thanks for sharing the terminal output! Based on this log, here's what's happening and likely causing your login issue:

---

### üîç **Main Problem**
The key error is this:
```
[storage] Error getting user by username: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')
Login failed: Invalid username or password
```

This means that **when your login function tries to access a property (probably `_id.toString()` or `password.toString()`), the user object is `undefined`** ‚Äî which means no user was found in the database for the provided username.

---

### üí• **Why it works on register but not on login**

- When you register, everything goes fine ‚Äî the user is saved to MongoDB.
- But when you try to **log in again**, the code that tries to fetch the user from the database is **not finding the user** ‚Äî so `user` becomes `undefined`, and calling `.toString()` on it throws an error.

### üß† Possible Causes

1. **Case sensitivity or typo in the login form:**
   - Maybe you're registering with `"Qqqq"` but trying to log in with `"qqqq"`.
   - MongoDB is **case-sensitive** by default, so `"Qqqq"` ‚â† `"qqqq"`.

2. **Your `findOne()` query might be incorrect:**
   ```js
   const user = await User.findOne({ username });
   ```
   - If `username` is empty or has spaces or is not trimmed, it won‚Äôt match.
   - Log the `username` just before this query to confirm.

3. **Your `User` schema might have unique constraints or different field names:**
   - For example, you might be saving the username as `userName` during register but querying `username` during login.

4. **Corrupted or invalid data in the DB:**
   - If the saved document is malformed or missing fields (`username`, `password`), the query could return `undefined`.

### ‚úÖ Suggested Fixes

1. **Sanitize input on login:**
   ```js
   const username = req.body.username?.trim().toLowerCase();
   ```

2. **Add a check before calling `.toString()`**
   ```js
   if (!user) {
     console.log("User not found with username:", username);
     return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid username or password" });
   }
   ```

3. **Log the actual data being saved and queried:**
   - In your register function: `console.log("Registered user:", newUser);`
   - In your login function: `console.log("Looking for user:", username);`
